- 👋 Hi, I'm @48Coder
- 👀 I'm passionate about mastering the art of implementing programming in online functional businesses and continuously evolving as a programmer. My goal is to harness the power of various virtual tools to provide top-notch services.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, equipping myself with a versatile skill set to tackle a wide range of projects and challenges.
- 💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on any project that will not only expand my knowledge but also push my boundaries as a programmer. If you have an opportunity where I can contribute and grow, I'd love to be part of it!
- 🌮 I'm mexican but I can also speak English, so feel confident including me in proyects from both languages.
